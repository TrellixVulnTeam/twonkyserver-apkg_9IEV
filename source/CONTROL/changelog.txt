# What’s New in Twonky Server v7.2.7 #

## 1 New feature ##
- Added support for DSD file format 

## 2 Improvement ##
- Added device detection for Samsung TV F series (2013)
- Improved the Samsung TV device adaptation for better handling of full HD pictures
- New ini-property to define album art behavior:
  If a content item does not contain embedded album art, Twonky Server can use album art from other media items within corresponding album.
  Default value is 0, i.e. album art fallback enabled for music and videos. disablealbumart_fallback=0
  If set to 1, album art fallback for music will be disabled i.e. the embedded album art for one music title isn't used for all music items in the view.
  If set to 2, album art fallback for videos will be disabled i.e. the embedded album art for one video item isn't used for all video items in the view.
  If set to 3, album art fallback for both music and videos will be disabled.
- Fixed problem in UTF-8 encoding for certain three-byte UTF-8 characters
- Network communication improvements on MAC
- Fixed problem in Web-based beam control when using mute.
- Default settings change! Per default time seek generation is disabled for Twonky Server. This means that initial scan will be a lot faster but some clients won't any longer be able to time seek on the media. The time seek generation can be turn on again by setting disabletimeseek=0 in the ini-file
- Added 8Player to Twonky’s device DB

## 3 Bug fixes ##

## 4 Known issues ##
- Same named albums and sorting behavior of Twonky Server: When you have same named albums from different artists in your media collection and you chose the "Album" navigation the titles from both albums will end up together in one view. We checked how to improve this behavior but each fix we found would have caused tremendous performance problems so we decided not to offer a fix.
  In case you have this problem we can only suggest that you manually change the metadata of the album(s) that cause this behavior.


# What’s New in Twonky Server v7.2.6 #

## 1 Improvement ##
- Improved Web UI behavior when the "ignored directories" were changed.
- Improved the installation behavior. If upload or aggregation is disabled for Twonky Server neither the upload nor the mirror folders get created. This is only visible at initial installation - if the upload or mirror folders are present from a former installation of Twonky Server they won't get removed.
- The upload and mirrored folders are configurable now. The new properties can be set in the ini-file and are named:
  - uploadmusicdir
  -uploadpicturedir
  -uploadvideodir
  -mirroredmusicdir
  -mirroredpicturedir
  -mirroredvideodir
  If upload and mirroring is disabled no respective folder will be created by Twonky Server.
- We cleaned up the navigation tree. Therefore we eradicated some categories which were duplicates. No functionality was lost with the changes but Twonky Server got faster and uses less memory now.
- Improved Twonky Server’s subtitle support. The server is now able to add subtitle files after the content has already been scanned. Previously, subtitle files had to be placed there prior to the content.
 This improvement works only for systems that support file system event notifications.

## 2 Bug fixes ##
- Fixed a bug at browsing the online videos which sometimes led to long response times
- Fixed a bug at the Web UI which always indicated that Twonky Server is streaming although the streaming was stopped. Note: This behavior can still be seen on devices with huge buffers.
- Fixed the Windows Start menu entry that pointed to twonkyforum instead of community.twonky.com
- Fixed the bug for Twonky Server on Linux system where configuration files were written into two different folders
- Several bugs related to the Online Services were fixed
- Fixed some problems for the persistent device database. The device types are better recognized now and the client expiration time was fixed. Also problems switching networks or having more than on network adapter accessible were addressed.
- Fixed that a remote browser accessing the Web UI of Twonky Server was identified as Twonky Server in the media receiver list.
- Fixed default shares on Mac. Previously the entries for music and photo folders were incorrectly set.
- Fixed a problem with the tray app on MacOS where the server wasn’t terminated correctly so that the server couldn’t be started and stopped from the tray app properly.

## 3 Known issues ##
- Some Online Services problems aren't fixed: Occasionally seen problems with facebook feeds
- For Genre/Artist/Album and Playlists the server offers wrong albumart: Instead of the first valid albumart the default albumart is used as thumbnail.
- We have seen occasional hangs in the web UI when the navigation tree view was changed repeatedly.
